# Arduino Based Projects

This repository features a collection of Arduino projects designed for learning, experimentation, and real-world applications. Each project includes 3d models, STL files, code and circuit diagrams to help you explore and expand your knowledge of Arduino and electronics.

### [1. Manual Gearbox Simulator:](./Manual%20Gearbox%20Simulator/)

This project simulates the operation of a manual gearbox using an Arduino Uno, a joystick for gear shifting, and an OLED display to show the current gear. It's a fun and educational way to learn basic electronics and coding with Arduino.
